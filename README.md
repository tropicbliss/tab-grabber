# Tab Grabber

A Minecraft HUD mod that aggregates information shown on the tab menu into an easily parseable format.
Using custom regex fully customisable by the user, this mod is able to show the parsed information as a HUD on screen.
This allows the user to not have to constantly press the tab key on servers if they want to constantly view information
shown on the tab menu.

**_NOTE:_** Even though scoreboards are also available on single player, for simplicityâ€™s sake this mod will not support
that particular use case.
